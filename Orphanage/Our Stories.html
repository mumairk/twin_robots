										I was the only child of my parents. I was 10 days old when both my parents died in an accident and I was sent to an orphanage in Karachi. From there I was adopted by a couple who had been married 8 years but did not have any kids of their own. Allah blessed them with children and they did not feel the need to love me so they dropped me off at MY HOME.<p>As soon as I got to MY HOME it was lunch time so I sat down with all my new sisters to eat. Since that day I have not looked back at my adoptive parents. I go to school now and look forward to becoming a teacher when I grow up.</p>

										I am 6 years old and an only child. My mother died giving birth to me and my father is suffering from cancer, doctors have cut of his leg. There was no one to take care of me. A woman from my village knew of the Ibraheem Trust and brought me to MY HOME. I go to school now; I am the fastest runner in my class.</p>

										My father was 1 of 5 men killed in a land dispute when I was young. I have 4 brothers and 3 sisters. My mother farms some land which she rents in our village but is unable to take care of all of us. I came to MY HOME through a friend of my mother.<p>
I am now in the 2nd grade.  I want to become a nurse when I grow up so I can help the ill and sick in my village.

										My father murdered my mother and was sent to jail. One of my relatives took me in to clean their house and take care of their kids. I was abused and beaten, they broke my nose. When I was almost 10 years old one day the neighbors gave me some money and put me on a bus to some other relatives house. They could not afford to take care of me so I found my way to MY HOME.</p>
